# Career Summary

\vspace{-0.1cm}

I am an Engineer from the Technical University of Madrid (Spain) with 10+ years of research and teaching experience. I have done an MSc in Environmental Research, Modelling and Risk Assessment, and a PhD in Earth Science. My main research area is environmental science, with a particular interest in radon as a natural hazard. My prior experience is in soil pollution, hydrocarbon exploration, fractured media characterization and geological storage of $CO_2$. Recently, I have started a postdoc in Geoinformatics on Migration Modelling at Aalborg University (Denmark). I am collaborating with the research group of Applied Marine Microbiology at Høgskulen på Vestlandet (Norway), where I have presented several projects for funding to the Norwegian Research Council, NordForsk, and the European Commission (Marie Sklodowska-Curie).

My research interests are:

-   Environmental risk assessment
-   Statistics, spatial data analysis, and geostatistics
-   Geographic information systems
-   R language
