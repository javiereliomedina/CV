abstract = {Geologic storage of carbon dioxide (CO2) has been proposed as a viable means for reducing anthropogenic CO2 emissions. Once injection begins, a program for measurement, monitoring, and verification (MMV) of CO2 distribution is required in order to: a) research key features, effects and processes needed for risk assessment; b) manage the injection process; c) delineate and identify leakage risk and surface escape; d) provide early warnings of failure near the reservoir; and f) verify storage for accounting and crediting. The selection of the methodology of monitoring (characterization of site and control and verification in the post-injection phase) is influenced by economic and technological variables. Multiple Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) refers to a methodology developed for making decisions in the presence of multiple criteria. MCDM as a discipline has only a relatively short history of 40 years, and it has been closely related to advancements on computer technology. Evaluation methods and multicriteria decisions include the selection of a set of feasible alternatives, the simultaneous optimization of several objective functions, and a decision-making process and evaluation procedures that must be rational and consistent. The application of a mathematical model of decision-making will help to find the best solution, establishing the mechanisms to facilitate the management of information generated by number of disciplines of knowledge. Those problems in which decision alternatives are finite are called Discrete Multicriteria Decision problems. Such problems are most common in reality and this case scenario will be applied in solving the problem of site selection for storing CO2. Discrete MCDM is used to assess and decide on issues that by nature or design support a finite number of alternative solutions. Recently, Multicriteria Decision Analysis has been applied to hierarchy policy incentives for CCS, to assess the role of CCS, and to select potential areas which could be suitable to store. For those reasons, MCDM have been considered in the monitoring phase of CO2 storage, in order to select suitable technologies which could be techno-economical viable. In this paper, we identify techniques of gas measurements in subsurface which are currently applying in the phase of characterization (pre-injection); MCDM will help decision-makers to hierarchy the most suitable technique which fit the purpose to monitor the specific physic-chemical parameter.},

abstract = {Fundaci{\'{o}}n Ciudad de la Energ{\'{i}}a (CIUDEN) is carrying out a project of geological storage of CO 2, where CO 2 injection tests are planned in saline aquifers at a depth of 1500m for scientific objectives and project demonstration. Before any CO 2 is stored, it is necessary to determine the baseline flux of CO 2 in order to detect potential leakage during injection and post-injection monitoring.In November 2009 diffuse flux measurements of CO 2 using an accumulation chamber were made in the area selected by CIUDEN for geological storage, located in Hontomin province of Burgos (Spain). This paper presents the tests carried out in order to establish the optimum sampling methodology and the geostatistical analyses performed to determine the range, with which future field campaigns will be planned. {\textcopyright} 2012 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {A new high spatial resolution radon risk map of Ireland has been developed, based on a combination of indoor radon measurements (n = 31,910) and relevant geological information (i.e. Bedrock Geology, Quaternary Geol-ogy, soil permeability and aquifer type). Logistic regression was used to predict the probability of having an in-door radon concentration above the national reference level of 200 Bq m −3 in Ireland. The four geological datasets evaluated were found to be statistically significant, and, based on combinations of these four variables, the predicted probabilities ranged from 0.57% to 75.5%. Results show that the Republic of Ireland may be divided in three main radon risk categories: High (HR), Medium (MR) and Low (LR). The probability of having an indoor radon concentration above 200 Bq m −3 in each area was found to be 19%, 8% and 3%; respectively. In the Republic of Ireland, the population affected by radon concentrations above 200 Bq m −3 is estimated at ca. 460 k (about 10% of the total population). Of these, 57% (265 k), 35% (160 k) and 8% (35 k) are in High, Medium and Low Risk Areas, respectively. Our results provide a high spatial resolution utility which permit customised radon-awareness information to be targeted at specific geographic areas.},

abstract = {CO2flux measurements at the soil-atmosphere interface are commonly carried out as part of site characterization in areas elected for CO2geological storage purposes. This approach represents an important monitoring tool to detect and quantify leakages during operational and post-operational stages related to the injection of anthropogenic CO2.A large variety of techniques to measure diffuse CO2soil flux is available and one of the most widely used is the accumulation chamber method. With this method, the total output is statistically estimated after measuring the CO2flux in selected points of a certain area. Several statistical approaches can be applied and it is important to select the most representative and significant procedure. Consequently, in this paper six different methods were used to calculate the total CO2output, as follows: arithmetic mean, minimum variances unbiased estimator, bootstrap resample, partitioning of data into different populations with graphical and maximum likelihood procedures, and sequential Gaussian simulation.Eight campaigns were carried out in the Hontom{\'{i}}n CO2Storage Technology Development Plant (Burgos, Spain) and in natural analogs of CO2storage (Campo de Calatrava, Spain and Mt. Amiata, Caprese Michelangelo and La Solfatara, Italy). Our results showed that sequential Gaussian simulation is the most precise method for evaluating the total CO2output and the respective confidence interval. Nevertheless, the estimation of the total CO2output with other statistical methodologies allowed to develop an application procedure for choosing the most reliable and realistic approach.},

abstract = {From the end of 2013 and during the following two years, 20kt of CO2sc are planned to be injected in a saline reservoir (1500m depth) at the Hontom{\'{i}}n site (NE Spain). The target aquifers are Lower Jurassic limestone formations which are sealed by Lower Cretaceous clay units at the Hontom{\'{i}}n site (NE Spain). The injection of CO2 is part of the activities committed in the Technology Development phase of the EC-funded OXYCFB300 project (European Energy Program for Recovery - EEPR, http://www.compostillaproject.eu), which include CO2 injection strategies, risk assessment, and testing and validating monitoring methodologies and techniques.Among the monitoring works, the project is intended to prove that present-day technology is able to monitor the evolution of injected CO2 in the reservoir and to detect potential leakage. One of the techniques is the measurement of CO2 flux at the soil-atmosphere interface, which includes campaigns before, during and after the injection operations.In this work soil CO2 flux measurements in the vicinity of oil borehole, drilled in the eighties and named H-1 to H-4, and injection and monitoring wells were performed using an accumulation chamber equipped with an IR sensor. Seven surveys were carried out from November 2009 to summer 2011. More than 4000 measurements were used to determine the baseline flux of CO2 and its seasonal variations.The measured values were low (from 5 to 13gm-2day-1) and few outliers were identified, mainly located close to the H-2 oil well. Nevertheless, these values cannot be associated to a deep source of CO2, being more likely related to biological processes, i.e. soil respiration. No anomalies were recognized close to the deep fault system (Ubierna Fault) detected by geophysical investigations. There, the CO2 flux is indeed as low as other measurement stations. CO2 fluxes appear to be controlled by the biological activity since the lowest values were recorded during autumn-winter seasons and they tend to increase in warm periods. Two reference CO2 flux values (UCL50 of 5gm-2d-1 for non-ploughed areas in autumn-winter seasons and 3.5 and 12gm-2d-1 for in ploughed and non-ploughed areas, respectively, in spring-summer time, and UCL99 of 26gm-2d-1 for autumn-winter in not-ploughed areas and 34 and 42gm-2d-1 for spring-summer in ploughed and not-ploughed areas, respectively) were calculated. Fluxes higher than these reference values could be indicative of possible leakage during the operational and post-closure stages of the storage project. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {The Campo de Calatrava Volcanic Field (CCVF) located in central-southern Spain (along with Selva-Emporda in Catalonia, NE Spain) is regarded as one of the most important CO 2 emitting zones in Peninsular Spain. Here, we report and evaluate new molecular and isotopic geochemistry of thermal waters and CO 2- rich gas discharges from the CCVF. Locally, these CO 2 -rich fluid emissions represent the remnants of the past volcanic activity that affected this area from the late Miocene through the Quaternary, with the most recent events occurring in the Holocene. The locations of discharging fluids and previous volcanic centers appear to be aligned along well-defined NW-SE and NNW-SSE lineaments, with subordinate trends in the ENE-WSW direction. The chemical and isotopic composition of the thermal waters suggests a meteoric origin, dominated by three distinct geochemical facies: 1) HCO 3 -Mg(Ca) type waters, associated with a relatively shallow aquifer and related to the interaction of meteoric waters with CO 2 -rich gases, alkaline volcanic products, and sedimentary formations, 2) SO 4 (Cl)-Ca(Mg) type waters, which stems from the two rivers (Guadiana and Jabal{\'{o}}n) that drain Triassic evaporitic rocks before entering the study area, and 3) HCO 3 -Na type waters, hosted in deep geopressurized CO 2 -rich reservoirs within the Ordovician basement rocks. The 87 Sr/ 86 Sr isotopic compositions (ranging between 0.70415 and 0.71623) and $\delta$ 34 S-SO 4 values (+10.7 to +18.3‰ vs. CDT) of CO 2 -rich fluids are consistent with interactions between water and either the Paleozoic basement, Triassic evaporites, Quaternary volcanic rocks, or a combination thereof. Dissolution of a CO 2 -rich gas phase into the aquifer produces low pH values (down to 5.4) and enhances water-rock interactions causing relatively high salinity (Total Ionic Salinity: up to ∼185 meq/L). Carbon dioxide is by far the most abundant gas constituent (up to 992 mmol/mol) and is dominated by mantle-derived sources as indicated by the combination of relatively high helium isotopic ratios (up to 2.7 R/Ra), high isotopic ratios of carbon in CO 2 (ranging between −6.8 and −3.2‰ V-PDB), and the carbon isotopic signature of TDIC (from −6.8 to +2.2‰ vs. VPDB). In the last two decades, numerous (CO 2 -rich) gas blowouts have occurred in the area during well drillings, suggesting the presence of a geopressurized gas reservoir at relatively shallow depth.},

Samples were analyzed for elemental composition (37 elements), pH, redox potential, organic carbon, and CaCO3 content, and a group of 16 selected samples were additionally subjected to a Tessier sequential extraction. Co and Mn soil concentrations were significantly higher inside the industrial facility and around its perimeter than in background samples, and maximum dissolved Co and Mn concentrations were found in a creek near the plant's discharge point, reaching values 17,700 and 156 times higher than their respective background concentrations. The ecological risk was evaluated as a function of Co and Mn fractionation and bioavailability which were controlled by the environmental conditions generated by the advance of seawater into the estuarine system during high tide. Co appeared to precipitate near the river mouth due to the pH increase produced by the influence of seawater intrusion, reaching hazardous concentrations in sediments. In terms of their bioavailability and the corresponding risk assessment code, both Co and Mn present sediment concentrations that result in medium to high ecological risk whereas water concentrations of both elements reach values that more than double their corresponding Secondary Acute Values.},

abstract = {CO2 capture and storage (CCS) projects are presently developed to reduce the emission of anthropogenic CO2 into the atmosphere. CCS technologies are expected to account for the 20% of the CO2 reduction by 2050. Geophysical, ground deformation and geochemical monitoring have been carried out to detect potential leakage, and, in the event that this occurs, identify and quantify it. This monitoring needs to be developed prior, during and after the injection stage. For a correct interpretation and quantification of the leakage, it is essential to establish a pre-injection characterization (baseline) of the area affected by the CO2 storage at reservoir level as well as at shallow depth, surface and atmosphere, via soil gas measurements. Therefore, the methodological approach is important because it can affect the spatial and temporal variability of this flux and even jeopardize the total value of CO2 in a given area. In this sense, measurements of CO2 flux were done using portable infrared analyzers (i.e., accumulation chambers) adapted to monitoring the geological storage of CO2, and other measurements of trace gases, e.g. radon isotopes and remote sensing imagery were tested in the natural analogue of Campo de Calatrava (Ciudad Real, Spain) with the aim to apply in CO2 leakage detection; thus, observing a high correlation between CO2 and radon (r=0,858) and detecting some vegetation indices that may be successfully applied for the leakage detection.},

Three alpha spectroscopy monitors were used to measure radon in soil air in a 25,000-m 2 area, following a regular sampling design with a 20-m 2 grid. Repeatability and reproducibility of the results were assessed by means of duplicate measurements in six sampling positions. Furthermore, three points not affected by oil spills were sampled to estimate radon background concentration in soil air. Data histograms, Q-Q plots, variograms, and cluster analysis allowed to recognize two data populations, associated with the possible path of a fault and a lithological discontinuity. Even though the concentration of radon in soil air was dominated by this discontinuity, the characterization of the background emanation in each lithological unit allowed to distinguish areas potentially affected by NAPL, thus justifying the application of radon emanometry as a screening technique for the delineation of NAPL plumes in sites with lithological discontinuities.},

abstract = {In this paper the very first geochemical and isotopic data related to surface and spring waters and dissolved gases in the area of Hontom{\'{i}}n-Huermeces (Burgos, Spain) are presented and discussed. Hontom{\'{i}}n-Huermeces has been selected as a pilot site for the injection of pure (>99%) CO2. Injection and monitoring wells are planned to be drilled close to 6 oil wells completed in the 1980s for which detailed stratigraphical logs are available, indicating the presence of a confined saline aquifer at the depth of about 1500m into which less than 100,000 tons of liquid CO2 will be injected, possibly starting in 2013.The chemical and features of the spring waters suggest that they are related to a shallow hydrogeological system as the concentration of the Total Dissolved Solids approaches 800mg/L with a Ca2+(Mg2+)-HCO3\n- composition, similar to that of the surface waters. This is also supported by the oxygen and hydrogen isotopic ratios that have values lying between those of the Global and the Mediterranean Meteoric Water Lines. Some spring waters close to the oil wells are characterized by relatively high concentrations of NO3\n- (up to 123mg/L), unequivocally suggesting an anthropogenic source that adds to the main water-rock interaction processes. The latter can be referred to Ca-Mg-carbonate and, at a minor extent, Al-silicate dissolution, being the outcropping sedimentary rocks characterized by Palaeozoic to Quaternary rocks. Anomalous concentrations of Cl-, SO4\n2-, As, B and Ba were measured in two springs discharging a few hundred meters from the oil wells and in the Rio Ubierna. These contents are significantly higher than those of the whole set of the studied waters and are possibly indicative of mixing processes, although at very low extent, between deep and shallow aquifers. No evidence of deep-seated gases interacting with the Hontom{\'{i}}n-Huermeces waters was recognized in the chemistry of the dissolved gases. This is likely due to the fact that they are mainly characterized by an atmospheric source as highlighted by the high contents of N2, O2 and Ar and by N2/Ar ratios that approach that of ASW (Air Saturated Water) and possibly masking any contribution related to a deep source. Nevertheless, significant concentrations (up to 63% by vol.) of isotopically negative CO2 (<-17.7‰ V-PDB) were found in some water samples, likely related to a biogenic source.The geochemical and isotopic data of this work are of particular importance when a monitoring program will be established to verify whether CO2 leakages, induced by the injection of this greenhouse gas, may be affecting the quality of the waters in the shallow hydrological circuits at Hontom{\'{i}}n-Huermeces. In this respect, carbonate chemistry, the isotopic carbon of dissolved CO2 and TDIC (Total Dissolved Inorganic Carbon) and selected trace elements can be considered as useful parameters to trace the migration of the injected CO2 into near-surface environments. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier Ltd.},
